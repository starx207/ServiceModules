# ServiceRegistryModules.Abstractions
---
This is a lightweight package that provides the base classes for configuring a registry module for the
`ServiceRegistryModules` package. Use this anywhere you need to implement an `IRegistryModule` but don't
need the functionality of applying the registries.

For more information, check out the [ServiceRegistryModules documentation](https://github.com/starx207/ServiceRegistryModules/blob/master/README.md#serviceregistrymodules)
