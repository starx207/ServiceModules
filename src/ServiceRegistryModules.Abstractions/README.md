# ServiceRegistryModules.Abstractions
---
This is a lightweight package that provides the base classes for configuring a registry module for the
`ServiceRegistryModules` package. Use this anywhere you need to implement an `IRegistryModule` but don't
need the functionality of applying the registries.

__TODO: provide link to documentation for "ServiceRegistryModules" package which is where I'll put the
full implementations details.__
